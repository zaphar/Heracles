# Heracles

An alternative dashboard viewer and manager for prometheus style metrics.

* Stateless. There is no persistent storage for this dashboard.
* File based configuration. Just YAML to define your dashbaords.
* Single binary install

Basically this is a small handmade simple to deploy dashboard viewer for prometheus metrics
and loki log queries.

We aren't looking to make it a full on replacement for Grafana/New Relic/Honeycomb or any
of those things. But if you want an easy to deploy and use dashboard viewer for your homelab
then this might be make your life just a little bit simpler.
