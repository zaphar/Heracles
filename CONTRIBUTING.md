# Contributing to Heracles

If you would like to help out with Heracles development then this document
outlines what you can expect.

Heracles is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. You are welcome to clone or
copy this source and make any modifications you like with no obligations other
than what is in the License. If you wish to contribute those changes back then
you should follow the below steps.

1. Create or identify an existing Github Issue outlining what you wish to add to the project.
   This will allow you to get feedback on whether your proposed changes fit with
   the direction I want to take Heracles in.
2. Submit a PR to the project referencing the Issue from above for review.
   At this time I have no defined SLA on responses to PRs or Issues since this
   is effectively a hobby project for personal use. Don't let that discourage
   you though. If you are patient I will eventually get back to you.
3. If all goes well with the above then your PR will get merged.

## Notes on acceptable contributions

* We are not interested in adding a database for configuration at this time.
* Alternative sources of metrics or log queries are of interest to us.
  But note that if the system is not one I use regularly or have access to then
  my capacity to maintain that integration will be limited. It's continued
  existence in Heracles will be dependent on your support of it. If that support
  is beyond you it may get removed in future versions.
* We wish to preserve the single binary deploy nature of Heracles. So changes that
  violate that will be rejected.

# Code of Conduct

Mostly I just want you to be respectful and professional, but the arbiter of
that is me. I'm not interested in getting super legal about what is allowed and
what isn't at this time. If you act like a bully then you'll be persona non
grata. Otherwise have fun with the project.
